**About tailwind css and integrating it with react**

```
(a)Tailwind css file is compiled to the main.css file which is then added to our application.More like how sass is compiled.
This done is via a build script.

(b)Compiling it is like bringing in the new classes.

(c)app .js and index.js are the most imporatant javascript files.

```

**UseState and UseEffect**

```
(a)useState is similar like setState with hooks and useEffect works similarly like life cycle methods.


(b)useState allows functional components to have state, like this.state in class components.
useEffect allows functional components to have lifecycle methods (such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount)

(c)when ever you add something to env you must restart your server.

(d)Props can take in a state value.This is very important to remember.looping though should
have a unique id.
